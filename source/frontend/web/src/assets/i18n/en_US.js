        txt_6: 'Investments involve risks. The prices of units / shares of collective investment schemes fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. The price of the units/ shares of a unit trust or finance product may move up and down and may become valueless, and investors may not get back the amount they have invested. It is as likely that losses will be incurred rather than profits made as a result of buying and selling unit trusts or finance products. Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Potential investors should read the terms and conditions contained in the relevant offering documents and in particular the investment policies and the risk factors before any investment decision is made. Investors should ensure they fully understand the risks associated with the unit trusts or finance products and should also consider their own investment objective and risk tolerance level. Investors are reminded that the value and income (if any) from shares of the product may be volatile and could change substantially within a short period of time, and investors may not get back the amount they have invested in the product. If in doubt, please seek independent financial and professional advice.',
